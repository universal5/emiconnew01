                Emicon Corporation offices and manufacturing facilities are located in El Paso TX. Like other jurisdictions El Paso, TX has taken 
                drastic measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Due to the nature of our business at Emicon Corporation we will maintain 
                operations in our facility as an essential business at this time. Currently we are handling phone calls and emails and manufacturing 
                and shipping products as per normal business. As the situation develops we will be providing up to date information.
